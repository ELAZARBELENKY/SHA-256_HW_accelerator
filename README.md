# sha-256 HW accelerator
Hardware-accelerated SHA-256 implemented on a PYNQ-Z2 FPGA. Includes custom SystemVerilog IP, AXI4-Lite/DMA integration, and Python/Jupyter interface. Achieves faster hashing for large data vs CPU


**🔐 SHA-256 Hardware Accelerator on PYNQ**

This repository contains the full implementation and documentation of a hardware-accelerated SHA-256 hashing engine developed as a final university project.

The project leverages the Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 FPGA platform to accelerate cryptographic hashing using a custom SystemVerilog IP core connected via AXI4-Lite and AXI-Stream DMA. The host interface is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook, enabling interactive hashing, benchmarking, and result validation.


**🚀 Features**

Full RTL implementation of SHA-256 per FIPS PUB 180-4
Custom SystemVerilog IP
Python interface running on PYNQ’s ARM cores for easy control and testing
Performance comparison vs software hashing to show hardware advantage on large datasets
Includes simulation, testbenches, waveform analysis, and full documentation


**📦 Contents**

rtl/        – SystemVerilog source for the SHA-256 core and wrapper  
tb/         – Testbenche, and waveform files
scripts/    – Project automation scripts TCL  
notebooks/  – Python Jupyter notebooks for usage, testing, and benchmarking  
report/     – Full project book in Hebrew describing the theory, design, implementation, and results  


**📊 Result Highlights**

Hardware beats software in performance for inputs ≥ 70KB

~2.6× speedup over CPU

Demonstrates how FPGAs can effectively offload compute-heavy cryptographic tasks


**🛠 Requirements**
* Vivado 2019.1
* PYNQ-Z2 board
* Python 3.x with PYNQ image
* Jupyter Notebook


## 🛠️ Rebuilding the Project in Vivado

⚠️ **Note:**
The generated bitstream (*.bit) and hardware description file (*.hwh) are already included in this repository under the bitstream/ folder.
You do not need to rebuild the project unless you want to:
\*Inspect or modify the design
\*Regenerate the bitstream manually
\*Integrate with custom logic or interfaces
The instructions below are for recreating the Vivado project from scratch.

To recreate the Vivado project and regenerate the bitstream:

1. **Clone this repository:**

       git clone https://github.com/ELAZARBELENKY/sha-256_HW_accelerator.git
       cd sha-256_HW_accelerator/scripts/

2. **Launch Vivado**  (recommended version: 2019.1) 

    On Windows:

       "C:/Xilinx/Vivado/2019.1/bin/vivado.bat"

   📝 Replace \2019.1 with your version of vivado.

    On Linux:

       vivado &

3. **Tcl Console**,

   In the Tcl Console (open with `Ctrl+Shift+T` inside Vivado), run:

       pwd

    Make sure the path ends in /scripts. If not, navigate there manually:

        cd /full/path/to/sha-256_HW_accelerator/scripts/

    📝 Replace /path/to/... with the actual full path to the project directory.

    Then run:

        source SHA256_HW_accelerator.tcl

4. **Vivado will:**
 *  Create a new project
 *  Add RTL sources and constraints
 *  Rebuild the block design
 *  Generate and add the BD wrapper
 *  Prepare everything for synthesis and implementation

5. **To generate the bitstream (optional step):**


       launch_runs impl_1 -to_step write_bitstream -jobs 4

   You can also do this via the Vivado GUI using Flow → Generate Bitstream.
